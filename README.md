### Thesis Outline Version a.01


# I am visualizing the worldwide territorial disputes with focus on maritime claims (in relation to the transformation of the arctic, due to the climate change), in order to build a visualization and scenario tool which shows how the territory of the sea comes into focus and interest of geopolitical players due to assumed resources in the sea-floor and advancing technology to extract them as well as new potential trade routes.

## (research) Questions

### What are the diplomatic and political implications of visualizing territorial claims?

### What are the different geopolitical scenarios and results if a) the claims are confirmed or b) declined ?

- 
- What are the economic changes (resources, trading routes) if the claim is confirmed/declined?
- What are the political changes/influences ( power, strategical points) if the claim is confirmed/declined?

### Why is it that the human made borders (e.g country borders) are dominant and omnipresent on all maps, but not the boundaries in the sea? How will that change in future?

### From the FAQ Section of the United Nations, UNCLOS Website:   
»Q5: Is there any map showing all maritime zones and limits worldwide?« 
» A5:As a matter of fact, no. […] it is not possible to show an accurate illustration of the extent of all maritime zones and location of maritime boundary delimitation lines. […]

- What is the reason that there is no official map? What are the diplomatic and political implications of such an visualization?
- What role plays the United Organisation in maritimal claims?

### What are potential scenarios in 25. 50, 100 years?

### Why is the sea territory until now in not such a big interest and how will it change in the future, due to advancing technological possibilities? Which historical analogies are there? Colonialism?

### How will the climate change in the artic change the geopolitical status quo?

- What are historical analogies? Suez canal?

### On how many layers/stages are the territorial  claims happening? Scientific, medial, diplomatic.

- What will a cartography of all those stages look like? What will it reveal?

### Is Science a good alternative to claim territorial? Is Science a proxy for hostile takeover?

### What does the »race for the sea» or the «race for the arctic« mean for the environment?

### How can a new Dataset with maritimal boundaries, claims, zones be created? What are the implications of doing so?

### How can the hypercomplex and unlegible process of maritimal claims at the UN be made visible?

- Is the UN and its processes of not readable/navigable by design? How can my tool change that?

## Area of interests in

### creating a visualization prototype as a tool of transformation, enabling changes of perspective and scenarios

- Mapping of uncertainty, complex, situations in fluxx, How can it be represented?
- Making the invisible visible

### Concepts of artificial (human made) Borders, their intersubjectivity and their inherent need of visualization

### Geopolitical scenarios

### Creating a new dataset for NGOS, policy makers, governments
