	- Diplomatic Process of each Claim

		- Timeline: Date of Claim Submission and related Diplomatic notes of Maritime Neighbours

- Research Questions

	- Convention on the Law of the Sea

		- Does the UNCLOS create  an Extractive Imaginary?

	- Metadata

		- How much claims in regard of the continental shelf are submitted?
		- What is the timeline of continental shelf claims?
		- Which states have advantages of the UNCLOS (coast states) and which not (land-locked states)?
		- Does the UNCLOS aggregrate or counter existing inequalities between countries?

	- Area Comparism

		- Which country is the one with the biggest/smallest EEZ area?
		- How big is the EEZ area compared to the country size?
		- How big is the EEZ area with potential accepted claim?
		- How do former colonizer still profit from their former colonies?

	- Diplomatic Process

		- Who are the stakeholders in each claim?

	- Cross referencing with other Datasets

		- Trading Routes
		- Mineral Resources

	- Semiotic
	- Case Study: General Debate

		- How are maritime claims mentioned in the General Debate by respective Countries?

	- Case Study: Arctic
	- Case Study: South China Sea
	- Case Study: France islands

# Research 4 - Prototyping
### Distinct Design Concept 1: "Text shapes the world" 
It is fascinating to observe in which short amount of time abstract concepts ( especially laws) shaped the concept of the oceans.
For hundred of years the ocean was international sea, free to navigate for everyone. The territorial border of the sea was depended on how far a canon was able to shoot 
(referred as the "cannon shot" rule). After the second world war, with the Law of the Sea, the ocean got more and more divided.
The dashboard tool takes this transformation of reality by text as a visual metaphor: The interface is divided into two halfs. 
The left space is reserved for the visualization, which depicts the world which gets shaped by abstract concepts. The user cannot at all interact with the left side,
and only watch it. The right side is reserved for the textual information and interface interactions. Changing documents, buttons, sliders and other interfaces on the right side, will transform the world on the left side.\
*Inspiration:*\
Law, Documents, Diplomatic notes.\
*Mockups:*\
![Img1](/distinc_concept_1.png)


### Distinct Design Concept 2: "Bold Questions, Bold Visualizations" 
The second direction is less academic in its approach; its strength is it simplicity and high stilistic style. It furthermore gives me, as a designer, the possibility to take a distinctive position. 
The context is only provided by questions. The Core of the visualization is a corpus of, say, 100 Question regarding territorial claims at the UN.
Each question is "answered" by a bold powerful fullscreen visualization. The interaction of the user with each visualization is very limited, restricted and on point.
Each visualization (and question) cann be seen as one (digital, animated) poster.\

### Thesis Outline Version a.01


# I am visualizing the worldwide territorial disputes with focus on maritime claims (in relation to the transformation of the arctic, due to the climate change), in order to build a visualization and scenario tool which shows how the territory of the sea comes into focus and interest of geopolitical players due to assumed resources in the sea-floor and advancing technology to extract them as well as new potential trade routes.

## (research) Questions

### What are the diplomatic and political implications of visualizing territorial claims?

### What are the different geopolitical scenarios and results if a) the claims are confirmed or b) declined ?

- 
- What are the economic changes (resources, trading routes) if the claim is confirmed/declined?
- What are the political changes/influences ( power, strategical points) if the claim is confirmed/declined?

### Why is it that the human made borders (e.g country borders) are dominant and omnipresent on all maps, but not the boundaries in the sea? How will that change in future?

### From the FAQ Section of the United Nations, UNCLOS Website:   
»Q5: Is there any map showing all maritime zones and limits worldwide?« 
» A5:As a matter of fact, no. […] it is not possible to show an accurate illustration of the extent of all maritime zones and location of maritime boundary delimitation lines. […]

- What is the reason that there is no official map? What are the diplomatic and political implications of such an visualization?
- What role plays the United Organisation in maritimal claims?

### What are potential scenarios in 25. 50, 100 years?

### Why is the sea territory until now in not such a big interest and how will it change in the future, due to advancing technological possibilities? Which historical analogies are there? Colonialism?

### How will the climate change in the artic change the geopolitical status quo?

- What are historical analogies? Suez canal?

### On how many layers/stages are the territorial  claims happening? Scientific, medial, diplomatic.

- What will a cartography of all those stages look like? What will it reveal?

### Is Science a good alternative to claim territorial? Is Science a proxy for hostile takeover?

### What does the »race for the sea» or the «race for the arctic« mean for the environment?

### How can a new Dataset with maritimal boundaries, claims, zones be created? What are the implications of doing so?

### How can the hypercomplex and unlegible process of maritimal claims at the UN be made visible?

- Is the UN and its processes of not readable/navigable by design? How can my tool change that?

## Area of interests in

### creating a visualization prototype as a tool of transformation, enabling changes of perspective and scenarios

- Mapping of uncertainty, complex, situations in fluxx, How can it be represented?
- Making the invisible visible

### Concepts of artificial (human made) Borders, their intersubjectivity and their inherent need of visualization

### Geopolitical scenarios

### Creating a new dataset for NGOS, policy makers, governments
